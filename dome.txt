Blockchain - Collection of all recent transactions happened & verified is a block by a miner
Public distributed database which holds the encrypted ledger
Group all these transaction details, create a hash code for this to store in a block
After verifications - Permanent Block - Block added to blockchain(keeps growing)
It is belived that in every 10 minutes a new block gets created & blockchain grows accordingly(in a timeframe)
Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrency(such as bitcoin,eth,polygon,etc.)
Bitcoin - Decentralized Digital Currency(first)
Came to market in 2009 by pseudoname - Satoshi Nakamoto
July 2009 - 1st blockchain came to implementation through bitcoin
Only 21 Million total bicoins can be created & till 17.09.21 we already created 18.78 Million of them
Miners use large machines to mine bitcoins as it requires solving very complex problems(most of the times miners in group invest to mine bitcoins)
Can't be created by any individual as it used cryptography and complex maths problems to control its creation and management (Upgradation on a regular basis)
Bitcoin system would not exhaust even if more miners come every day
Ensures last bitcoin to be mined till 2140(with increasing of complexity)
Miners Verify and validate transactions(after cheching all required past transactions)
Ledger System - Keep track of transactions ( completely electronic and highly secure )
Hash Code - Unique Identity of a block (minute change could change whole block)
Can't be reversed if once created - Can't be manipulated by anyone
Value of proof of that block - Mathmatical solution to attach with a block (ensure its validity)
Ledgers can't be manipulated by anyone
Produced by people using software that solves complex mathmatical problems to get valid output
It's copies gets distributed throughout the network
Changing one transaction could not be accepted as everyone has a valid ledger (so invalid gets rejected)
Sectors like Banking , Voting , Gaming could be completely changed through implementation of the blockchain
Games like axie infinity is already doing it(people even earn from such games)
Work on voting on a blockchain is currently going under work and could be implementd within few years
