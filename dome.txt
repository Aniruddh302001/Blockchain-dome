Blockchain - Collection of all recent transactions happened & verified is a block
Public distributed database which holds the encrypted ledger
Group all these transaction details, create a hash code for this to store in a block
After verifications - Permanent Block - Block added to blockchain(keeps growing)
It is belived that in every 10 minutes a new block gets created & blockchain grows accordingly(in a timeframe)
Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrency(such as bitcoin,eth,polygon,etc.)
Bitcoin - Decentralized Digital Currency(first)
Came to market in 2009 by pseudoname - Satoshi Nakamoto
July 2009 - 1st blockchain came to implementation through bitcoin
Only 21 Million total bicoins can be created & till 17.09.21 we already created 18.78 Million of them
Can't be created by any individual as it used cryptography and complex maths problems to control its creation and management (Upgradation on a regular basis)
Bitcoin system would not exhaust even if more miners come every day
Ensures last bitcoin to be mined till 2140(with increasing of complexity)
